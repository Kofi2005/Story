                    <p>Long ago, in a land far away, there were two towns called Biafra and Alakra. Biafra was the land of Gold, 
                        Silver and many beautiful Sapphires while Alakra was covered in thick bush and beautiful nature.
                    </p>

			<div><h1><span>Page</span>2</h1>
                    <p>Although the two towns had lived side by side for hundreds of years, they hated each other immensely. This is 
                        because the Alakrans were known to cause trouble and attack the Biafrans, stealing their gold and pillaging their villages.

            <div><h1><span>Page</span>3</h1>
                    <p>Because of this, the Biafrans were poor. All the Gold And Sapphires they worked so hard to mine day in and day out were stolen by the angry Alakrans who were spiteful of their lack of resources.

            <div><h1><span>Page</span>4</h1>
                    <p>The Alakrans always won their fights with the Biafrans as they had one man on their side. This man was Leeman the Cat.

            <div><h1><span>Page</span>5</h1>
                    <p>Leeman was a retired army general who was born to an Alakran father and Biafran mother. He stood at seven feet tall and had muscles the size of trucks. When he moved, his veins spread all over his arms and chest like a vineyard and he destroyed any man or woman that stood in his path.

            <div><h1><span>Page</span>6</h1>
                    <p>One day, the leader of the Biafrans went to the King of the Alakra and begged for them to stop the violence and fighting. The King of Alakra laughed hysterically then made a proposition. “If you can bring forth a man or woman that can defeat the Great Leeman The Cat and His Soldiers, we will leave your people alone”. The leader of the Biafrans Agreed.

            <div><h1><span>Page</span>7</h1>
                    <p>Quickly, word spread all over Biafra of a need for a challenger to defeat Leeman and his Soldiers. Men of all shapes and sizes came forward. Each trying their luck at the Big Warrior and his men only to fail every time.
